Now you can quickly create an easy link that anyone on Signal can use to join a group call without having to join a Signal group chat first.\n\nCall links are reusable and ideal for recurring phone dates with your best friends or weekly check-ins with your coworkers. You can manage your call links, control approval settings, and copy links from the calls tab for quick sharing. ",
